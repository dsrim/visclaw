This example adapted from $CLAW/amrclaw/examples/burgers_3d_cubedata.

Domain size changed from unit cube to [0,1] x [0,1.4] x [0,2] so it's easier
to tell x,y,z apart when experimenting.

Note: Refinement ratios must be equal for all levels with current version of yt.

Run the code with Clawpack version 5.3.1.


To make the matlab figures, start matlab and then "plotclaw3" at the prompt.
Assumes MATLABPATH includes $CLAW/visclaw/src/matlab.
Sample figures are in frame*.png.


See yt_plots.ipynb for some attempts at plotting with yt.
